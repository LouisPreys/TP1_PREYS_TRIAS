Synthesis Practical Work Ensea in the Shell

**Question 1 :**
The answer to this question is inside the file called "enseash.c".
For this question, we learned to separate the variable used in a different file called "constantHeader.h". This allows us to not accumulate a lot of variables in the main in order to see better what we are doing. 
We used the function write that takes three arguments, firstly, STDOUT_FILENO, which allows the message to be written in the console, then the message displayed, and finally the length of the message (we use a strlen() for that).
